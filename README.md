# SMSSecretary
This is Android application for smartphones.

It allows to control your device due the sms messaging. It is really useful to control your 
old parents, or children just sending SMSs. No need to paid for Data transferring, no need to worry about covering of 4G or something.
GSM is enough for SMSSecretary(by the way maybe that is not a good name?).

It will be about 10 possible feachers of control. I don't want to overhead and make an application too complex for using.
